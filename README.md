## DMS PDF EXTRACTOR
* * *

**Current versi√≥n**: 1.0

Last release: `07-08-2024`

### Description
This application is designed to extract PDFs from multimedia items contained within DMS documents. The idea is to program a application `query` to obtain these documents - for example `(Hoja_Recurso_Apelacion & $#NumeroCola=10)` and then proceed to process them according to the configured processing mode ( `workingMode` ).

If `workingMode=0`, the program will extract the PDF from each item and store it in the configured folder ( `targetFolder` ). These PDFs can also be truncated to only `N` pages by configuring the parameters `truncatePdfPages` and `pdfMaxPages` respectively. For example, if `truncatePdfPages=true` and `pdfMaxPages=2`, all PDFs with more than 2 pages will be truncated, leaving only 2 of the pages they contained. If `truncatePdfPages=false`, the PDFs remain as they were downloaded from the DMS repository. In this operating mode, the resulting files generated in the 'targetFolder' are named with the `DMS-ID + ".pdf"`.

If `workingMode=1`, the program will convert the pages of the PDFs either into JPEG files ( `transformJpegToBase64TextFile=false` ) or into text files containing a representation of the JPEG files encoded in Base64 ( `transformJpegToBase64TextFile=true` ). In this operating mode, the parameter `pdfMaxPages` will also be used to determine how many pages to extract at most from the PDF files. The resulting files in this operating mode (also in the folder specified in `targetFolder` ) are named with the `DMS-ID + PPP + EXTENSION`, where `PPP` refers to the page number in 3-digit format, for example, page 1 would be 001. The values for `EXTENSION` will be either `.jpg` or `.txt` when `transformJpegToBase64TextFile=true`.

To avoid having too many files in the root folder `targetFolder`, up to 10 subfolders will be created within it, with the name of these corresponding to the last two digits of the `DMS-ID` of the item obtained from the repository.



**Configuration File:** `appconfig.json`

**Sample:**
```json
{
    "dmsUri": "[URL API DMS]",
    "dmsUser": "[USER DMS]",
    "dmsPass": "[PASS DMS]",
    "dmsQuery": "[QUERY DMS]",
    "queryPageSize": 100,
    "maxPagesToQuery": -1,
    "workingMode": 1,
    "purgeFiles": true,
    "targetFolder": "[TARGET FOLDER]",
    "tempFolder": "[TEMP FOLDER]",
    "transformJpegToBase64TextFile": true,
    "popplerBinariesPath": "[LOCAL POPPLER BINARIES PATH]",
    "truncatePdfPages": false,
    "pdfMaxPages": 2,
    "jpegDpi": 100,
}
```

**About some** `appconfig.json` **parameters:**

- `purgeFiles` <code>[true|false]</code>
    - If in a document search with the configured query we obtained the documents with ID 1,2,3,4,5 and in a second query we obtain ID 3,4,5,6,7,8 , when purgeFiles=true the files corresponding to documents 1 and 2 will be deleted.
- `queryPageSize` This configuration is related to the backend paging (DMS) of results. For example, if there are 105 documents in the DMS and we set queryPageSize to 50, then 3 requests will be made to the DMS, obtaining in each one 50, 50 and 5 documents. The normal is to set it to 100 for or 200. The value must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.  Otherwise the default value (100) will be used.
- `maxPagesToQuery` This configuration is used to test a few documents and not have to wait to process all of them.  The default value in a productive environment should be -1, which means that we want to process ALL documents.  If we set a value, for example 2, what will happen is that after obtaining the second page of results the program will not continue searching for documents and will only process those obtained so far. 
Allowed values: -1 , and any value >=1 and <= 1000

### DISTRIBUTION

Use the script `build.bat` located in project root folder to generate executable (EXE) in the DIST folder of the project. Batch script also copies the configuration file to "DIST"  folder and some BIN files needed for packages like Pdf2Image.
